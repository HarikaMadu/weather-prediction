Weather Prediction Model Using Machine Learning
This project implements a weather prediction model using machine learning techniques in Python. The model predicts future weather conditions based on historical weather data, allowing users to anticipate important weather changes such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to real-world environmental data.

Key Features:
Data Collection: Historical weather data is collected, typically including features like temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and precipitation over time.
Preprocessing: The raw data is cleaned and preprocessed, handling missing values, normalizing numerical data, and converting categorical data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Model Selection: Various machine learning models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, are employed to predict weather parameters.
Model Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using standard metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score.
Prediction: The trained model can predict future weather conditions, such as daily temperatures, humidity, or precipitation levels.
Visualization: The results of the model predictions are visualized through charts and graphs for easier understanding and decision-making.
